Input: s = "XXOX"
Output: 2
Explanation: XXOX -> OOOX -> OOOO
We select the first 3 characters in the first move, and convert them to 'O'.
Then we select the last 3 characters and convert them so that the final string contains all 'O's.

Input: s = "XXX"
Output: 1
Explanation: XXX -> OOO

A move is defined as selecting three consecutive characters of s and converting them to 'O'. Note that if a move is applied to the character 'O', it will stay the same.

Return the minimum number of moves required so that all the characters of s are converted to 'O'.

class Solution {
    public int minimumMoves(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        int i=0;
        while(i<s.length()){
            if(s.charAt(i)=='X'){
                count++;
                i=i+3;
            }else{
                i++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
